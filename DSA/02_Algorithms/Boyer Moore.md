# Boyer Moore

## Overview
String search that skips ahead using mismatch heuristics from the pattern.

## Intuition
The algorithm is useful when the problem exposes a structure that can be repeatedly reduced without losing the desired answer. The implementation should make that reduction explicit through a maintained invariant, ordering rule, or recurrence.

## Formal Explanation
Define the input domain, the state maintained by the algorithm, and the operation that advances the state. At every step, the algorithm either finalizes a piece of information, narrows the candidate space, or combines solved subproblems. The final answer is correct only if each reduction preserves all feasible optimal answers or proves that discarded candidates cannot improve the result.

## Correctness
A correctness argument should identify the invariant, prove it holds initially, prove each update preserves it, and show that termination converts the invariant into the desired result. For greedy algorithms, include an exchange argument. For dynamic programs, prove the recurrence covers all valid choices exactly once or intentionally aggregates equivalent states.

## Complexity
Sublinear on many texts; worst-case requires careful variants.

## Implementation
Python implementations should prefer clear data structures from the standard library, especially list, dict, set, deque, and heapq. Keep reusable code in [[Template Index]] pages and keep problem-specific adaptations in [[Problem Index]].

## Applications
Practical text search over large alphabets and long patterns.

## Edge Cases
- Empty or minimal input
- Duplicate values, parallel edges, or equal weights where applicable
- Disconnected structures
- Boundary values that stress indexing or overflow assumptions
